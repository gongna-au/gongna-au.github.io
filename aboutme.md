Hello there! üëã

Welcome to my profile! I'm a fitness enthusiast and a budding backend developer, constantly expanding my horizons in the captivating world of coding. Studying at a prestigious 211 university in Wuhan, I'm surrounded by an inspiring academic environment that feeds my passion for technology and continuous learning.

My journey in backend development has been thrilling, as I delve into the intricacies of server-side applications and explore cutting-edge technologies and frameworks. But life isn't just about coding!

Outside of programming, I have a sweet tooth and a passion for baking. My kitchen often smells of freshly baked treats, and my favorite is the rich and creamy Basque cheesecake. The process of mixing, baking, and watching something delicious come to life is incredibly satisfying.

I'm also an avid traveler and hiker, with an insatiable appetite for adventure. My next destination? The majestic Bromo Volcano in Indonesia üåã. The thrill of exploring new places, immersing myself in different cultures, and trekking through breathtaking landscapes is something I can't get enough of.

And let's not forget about my love for cocktails! After a long day, you can find me crafting various cocktail recipes, exploring the subtle art of mixology. Whether it's balancing the bold flavors of a Negroni or the refreshing zest of a Mojito, each drink is a new adventure.

I cherish making new connections and friendships, especially with those who share similar interests in fitness, coding, baking, traveling, or a good cocktail. Let's connect! Whether it's for a project collaboration, sharing recipes, travel stories, or just a casual chat about our next adventure, I'm all ears.

Feel free to reach out, explore my repositories, and let's embark on this journey together.

Cheers to new friendships and shared adventures! üç∏
